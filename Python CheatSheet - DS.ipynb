    "A linked list is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are simple objects stored in memory with pointers.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Randown access is not allowed\n",

    "        - keep track of previous node\n",
    "        - when you identify the node to be deleted\n",
    "        - Set previous node.next to node to be deleted.next\n",
    "        - Set node to be deleted to None\n",
